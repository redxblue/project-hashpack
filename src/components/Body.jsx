              Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that underpins
              cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's a chain of blocks, where each block contains a batch of
              transactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              The blocks are linked together using cryptographic hashes, forming
              an immutable chain.
            </li>
            <li>
              Blockchain technology is decentralized, meaning no single entity
              has control over it.
            </li>
            <li>
              This decentralization enhances security, making it resistant to
              manipulation.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's often referred to as a "trustless" system because trust is
              established through math and cryptography.
            </li>
            <li>Transactions on the blockchain are public and transparent.</li>
            <li>
              Data is stored on a network of computers (nodes) instead of a
              central server.
            </li>
            <li>
              This network consensus ensures data integrity and reduces the risk
              of fraud.
            </li>
            <li>
              Blockchain's uses go beyond cryptocurrencies; it has applications

              Voting systems can be improved by using blockchain for secure and
              transparent elections.
            </li>
            <li>
              Healthcare records can be securely stored and shared using

              The technology can disrupt traditional intermediaries in various
              sectors.
            </li>
